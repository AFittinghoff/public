Tommy's Desserts serves cakes and ice cream for all of your dining and 
party needs (for both private homes and for restaurants). Their expert 
bakers have designed an extensive menu of various different sizes/flavors
of cakes, different ice creams, and different toppings. You can order 
desserts in-store, or you can have them ordered for an event. Customers 
can sign up for "favored" customer status.
